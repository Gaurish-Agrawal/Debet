 - DeBet is a betting platform where you can host, participate in, or watch live debates online. Users register for a debate and are randomly given a side to defend. As the debate's start time approaches, bets are placed by other users regarding the match's outcome. Bets are placed using an e-currency called “tokens.” Users can buy tokens with money to join and bet on debates. To judge objectively, a ChatGPT API is used to pick the winner. While earning money by predicting the match's outcome correctly is a possibility, losing money by betting incorrectly is also plausible.
